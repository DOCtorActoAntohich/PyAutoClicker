# PyAutoClicker
Simple autoclicker written in Python 3.

One day I was too lazy to spend 5 minutes in Terraria to use bug and get money. To do so, I had to click mouse. I thought that spending 8 hours to create an autoclicker was great idea!

P.S. I confess that the code can be bad because I wrote it in 2017 when I was young and stupid. On the other hand, it works ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

### Dependencies
* `pyautogui`
* `keyboard`

### How to use
1. Install all dependencies using `pip install *name*` in console.
2. Run the script and follow the instructions.
3. Use as long as you want.
4. Turn it off.
5. Thank the author.

### Default controls
* `PgDown` - change mouse button (default Left).
* `PgUp` - Turn clicking of/off (default off).
* `End` - Stop the script.

These controls can be changed in the script file.
